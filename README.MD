# Bayesian Quantum Amplitude Estimation

Implementation of [Bayesian quantum amplitude estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04394) and several other quantum amplitude estimation algorithms.

For usage, refer to the 'QAE demo' notebook. 

The 'Noise resilient QAE' is a 1st year PhD report describing the background and results for part of the code in this repository.
