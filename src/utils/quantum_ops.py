   ============================================================================
    Performs a measurement (single shot) on a circuit and returns the result,

    in the correct states, it prints a message in the console, but suppresses
    them still. The Aer simulator is used as the backend for the execution.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    qc: QuantumCircuit

    omit: [(int,str)]
        A list of qubits to suppress from the outcome, and their respective

        expected states. Default is None.

   ============================================================================
    Executes a circuit and presents the results as a histogram or a 
    statevector, possibly suppressing some qubits. If the qubits to be 
    suppressed are not in the correct states, it prints a message in the 
    console and does not suppress them. The Aer simulator is used as the 
    backend for the execution.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    qc: QuantumCircuit
        The quantum circuit to be measured.
    how: str , optional
        How to present the results: 
        - "counts" (return counts), or
        - "statevec" (print statevector), or 
        - "hist" (plot histogram).  
        Default is "statevec".
    meas_info: ([int],[int]) or [], optional
        A tuple containing the list of qubits to be measured and the list of
        classical bits to store the result to, in the 0 and 1 positions 
        respectively. They should have the same length and correspond to 
        valid registers in 'qc'. If None, all qubits will be measured into 
        a classical register added for the purpose. If empty, it will be 
        assumed the circuit already measures the intended qubits. Only used if 
        type=="hist". Default is None.
    omit: [(int,str)], optional
        A list of qubits to suppress from the results, and their respective
        states. We don't simply not measure them because we want to make sure
        they're in the expected states. Default is None.
    info: str, optional
        Some annotation to include in the title of the histogram or when
        printing the statevector on the console. Default is "".
    atol: float, optional
        The threshold amplitude for considering a state. If None, will use
        the one given by the atol attribute of Qiskit's Statevector class.
        Default is None.

    ----------
    string: str
        The state from which to suppress a qubit.
    which: [(int,str)]
